 SCROLL MAGIC IN PLAIN CSS

I was wondering about what happens, if a content element with overflow:scroll gets rotated by 90deg. The result: the content will scroll to the left when you scroll down. 

Make sure to use Chrome to watch this pen AND consider this as a experiment

Looks best when you resize your browser to something like portrait mode
